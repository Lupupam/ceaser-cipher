The ceaser cipher done in python.

Every character in the given word is shifted forward in the alphabet according to the given number.

The main focus of the project was practice, mainly the list comprehensions.
As it can be seen list comprehensions in the main function -the shift() function- are complex(at least in my level of skill), nested and they use every available feature of list comprehensions.
I didn't bother with translating the code to english just as I didn't bother with commenting.
However if anyone is interested I would happily translate and explain the code.
